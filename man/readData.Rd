\usage{
readData(fileDir, tofmin = 60, tofmax = 2000, extmin = 0,
  extmax = 10000, SVM = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fileDir}{The file or directory to be read. This can be an individual
file, a directory containing .txt files to be read, or the directory
containing the score and setup directories.}

\item{tofmin}{The minimum time of flight value allowed. Defaults to 60.}

\item{extmin}{The minimum extinction value allowed. Defaults to 0.}

\item{SVM}{Boolean specifying whether or not to use the support vector
machine to separate worms and bubbles.}

\item{tofmin}{The minimum time of flight value allowed. Defaults to 2000.}

\item{extmin}{The maximum extinction value allowed. Defaults to 10000.}
}
\value{
If a single file is given, a single data frame for only the provided
plate is returned. If an experiment directory is given, a list of two data
frames will be returned. The first element in the list will be a single data
frame for all of the score plates. The second element will be all of the
setup plates. If there are no setup plates, NA will fill the second list
element. If a setup or score directory is given, a single data frame of all
of the plates in the directory will be returned.

\description{
This is the primary fuction for reading data into R with this package. It is
built exlusively for use with worm data. This function can read in
individual plates, plates from a single directory (e.g. setup or score
directory), or plates from an experimental directory (with both score and
setup sub-directories). The files/directories to be read in (individual
file/directory/experiment directory) are detected and handled automatically
by the function. This function also utilizes an SVM to determine whether
objects are more likely to be bubbles or worms and labels them accordingly.
It also estimates the lifestage of each worm.
